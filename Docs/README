Pyarie: A Python aid for river/ecosystem modeling tasks

This is a program that I'm writting for use in my thesis
at Oregon State University. It is being used by me to both
develop and solve models in hydro-ecological systems.

I'm designing it as a more generic system solver method,
rather than as a specific ecosystem modeling package mainly
so that other those in other engineering or math-intensive
fields can use it.

Significant inspiration came from:
"Modelling and Simulation (Cs522) Final Project
A Hybrid Simulator: ODEs and Event Scheduling"
By: Olivier Dubois and Eric McSween
that I found at http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~emcswe/cs522/project/
However, it is a quite different program than their's. For
instance, Pyarie uses SimPy (http://simpy.sf.net) for
the scheduling and modeling framework.

Their Hybrid Solver program was great as a jumpstart, and 
I've built this using their design as a good "algorithm
checker" to develop Pyarie. However, I want to acknowledge 
their original work and thank them, because it would have 
been a significant task merely getting to a starting point
for developing a simulation program had it not been for 
their class project.
